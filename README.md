This project contains a classification pipeline to predict which recipe pages are likely to attract high traffic. Working with a dataset of 947 recipes (8 columns), I performed data validation and cleaning (normalizing category labels such as consolidating “Chicken Breast” under “Chicken,” imputing missing numeric values by within‑category means, dropping a few anomalous serving counts, and using one‑hot encoding for the categorical feature), applied variance‑stabilizing transforms for skewed variables (e.g., √calories), and ran a compact EDA to examine target balance, dummy/numeric distributions, feature–target relationships, and outliers. I trained and compared logistic regression and random forest models, tuning hyperparameters with cross‑validated grid search while optimizing for business‑relevant precision and validating results with ROC curves. Finally, I analyzed feature importance to surface actionable levers (nutritional attributes and category signals stood out) and translated the findings into recommendations for content and SEO prioritization. The notebook includes well‑commented code (pandas, scikit‑learn, matplotlib/seaborn, phik, SciPy) and reproducible steps so the analysis can be rerun or extended easily.
